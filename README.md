# Customer Churn Prediction API

End-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts customer churn using a trained ML model and exposes predictions via a FastAPI REST API.

---

##  Project Overview

This project covers the complete ML lifecycle:
- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Model serialization
- API development using FastAPI
- Local testing and deployment-ready setup

##  Model Details

- Algorithms tried: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Final model selected based on F1-score
- Output:
  - `prediction`: 0 (No churn) or 1 (Churn)
  - `probability`: likelihood of churn
